## About README 
### What is a README File?
In simple words, we can describe a README file as a guide that gives users a detailed description of a project you have worked on.

Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.
README is helpful 
To understand our prjoect for contributions made by others, provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place to reference what is expected by adding visual aids, screenshots.
Also if our project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.

Here are a few extra points to note when you're writing your README:

Keep it up-to-date - It is a good practise to make sure your file is always up-to-date. In case there are changes make sure to update the file where necessary.
Pick a language - We all come from different zones and we all speak different languages. But this does not mean you need to translate your code into vernacular. Writing your README in English will work since English is a globally accepted language. You might want to use a translator tool here if your target audience isn't familiar with English.

If your README is very long, you might want to add a table of contents to make it easy for users to navigate to different sections easily. It will make it easier for readers to move around the project with ease.

*The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

*What your application does,

*Why you used the technologies you used,

*Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
